# 🔐 ShadowShield

**ShadowShield** is a security-first REST API starter built with Express.js and TypeScript.  
Designed for secure applications, internal tools, or microservices — it's a perfect starting point for projects that need **JWT authentication**, **rate limiting**, and **clean modular architecture**.

## 🛡 Features

- 🔐 JWT-based login & route protection  
- 🧱 Input validation with Zod  
- ⛔ Rate limiting to prevent abuse  
- 🧠 Security headers via Helmet  
- 🌍 CORS support for API use  
- ⚙️ Environment configuration with `.env`  
- 🪵 Basic request logging  
- 🧩 Modular structure with routes, middleware, and utilities

> 💡 **Note:** ShadowShield does not include a database layer by default.  
> This gives you full control to implement your own storage solution using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, or any other database of your choice.
